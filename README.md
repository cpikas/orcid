Scripts for using various APIs and services to retrieve ORCID ids

More on what I'm doing here: https://christinaslisrant.scientopia.org/2019/09/25/finding-orcids-not-as-easy-as-you-think/

The main point is that asking researchers for their ORCID is doesn't always get a great response even though we know they are required to have ids because their publishers require them. Searching ORCID by affiliation returns only a small proportion because the researchers often don't fill out their profiles or mark them for sharing.

I'll also list things that are not effective for retrieving ORCIDs:
* IEEE Xplore GUI exports or API - this information is not accessible by either method
